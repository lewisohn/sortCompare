**Week 6 report** (Viikkoraportti 6)

This week I focused on the "data structures" part of "data structures and algorithms" title of this course. I finished up my custom ArrayList-like class, renaming it from CustomListPrototype to CustomList, with the previous CustomList now called CustomListLegacy. I wanted to finish its JUnit-test suite before utilising it in my program, which is now done. I also submitted my second code review.

Next I'll be working on my presentation of the program at the demo event on Wednesday.
