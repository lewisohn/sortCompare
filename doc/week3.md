**Week 3 report** (Viikkoraportti 3)

This week was cut short by three things: being abroad, being ill, and not being given the correct deadline to submit my work. I was still able to implement the Merge and Heap sorting algorithms, albeit using Java's ready-made PriorityQueue class for the latter.

Next week I'll work on the two remaining algorithms, Quick and Bucket. In week 5 I'll write my custom data structures, which will leave week 6 for debugging, refactoring and compiling a report.
