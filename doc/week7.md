**Week 7 report** (Viikkoraportti 7)

This week (two weeks) I have mostly been polishing the project's rough edges for its final submission. I fixed a few bugs, including one which was brought to my attention through the peer review (vertaisarvionti), which was helpful. I finally got around to making sure the project compiles and runs outside of my NetBeans instance - this meant saying goodbye to Maven, which I intended to utilise more than I ultimately did in the course of the project. Finally, I used a checkstyle plugin to make my code a little cleaner.

Once all of that was done I just had to prepare my documentation and do a final git push. It's been a fun course!
